Ok so for this challenge you are given a program called fd.c and told a hint that you have to know what a file descriptor is.
This basically means understaning file input and output and some c code as well.
You are given the code:
"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
char buf[32];
int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]) {
    if(argc<2){
        printf("pass argv[1] a number ");
        return 0;
    }
    int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
    int len = 0;
    len = read(fd, buf, 32);
    if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n",buf)){
        printf("good job :) ");
        system"/bin/cat flag");
        exit(0);
    }
    printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");
    return 0;
}
"
The code above will take a file desriptor as an argument.
The code will then read from that file descriptor after subtracting 4660 from the file descriptor.
This means the line
"
echo "Some text" | ./fd 4661
"
Will work. Then adding in "LETMEWIN\n" will next the flag.
